### Overview: ###
-----------------

This project aimed to visually show differences between magnitudes of earthquakes that have happened all over the world from the last seven days.

The GeoJSON earthquake data was retrieved from the USGS website retrieve geographical coordinates <https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/all_week>. JavaScript, HTML, the D3.js library, and css were all used to create an interactive webpage with multiple tile layers (overlays). On the right corner of the webpage, the tile layers have options to select earthquakes that have occurred in the past 7 days, visible tectonic plate boundaries, and layers displaying "major" earthquake data with magnitudes greater than 5.
